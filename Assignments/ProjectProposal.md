# Research Proposal
My research question focuses on analyzing whether the County of Los Angeles is prepared for more extreme heat. The question is, "If our CalEnviroScreen data is above the 90th percentile, what percentage of census tracts are within half a mile?"

# Why
The state of California is not taking extreme heat seriously. After an investigation with the Los Angeles Times uncovered, it shows that the state and city are undercounting deaths caused by heat waves and extreme high temperatures. Climate change has been a priority for Caifornia but has not focused much of it on heat as it is known to be a silent killer. If the state isn't taking appropiate action, we need to further analyze who has access to cooling spaces in case of an extreme heat event. This can show us the gaps that the state may need to address to ensure that people have the accessibility to a cooling facility. This includes looking at the walking distance of each cooling center in the county. As Governor Newsom has decided to focus on mitigating climate change impacts, they can focus on ensuring that those who do not have access to or can afford AC, they are able to cool themselves off during heat events in established cooling centers, I will not include parks or pools because even the usage of these spaces does not guarantee for someone to feel cool enough during heat events. If these measures are not taken, it can cause for thousands of fatilities as these heat events will become from frequent and stronger. 

# Spatial Scope
The area that I am focusing on is the County of Los Angeles. This matters to me as merely focusing on LA City or individual cities can take matters into their own hands. This can either be great or specific city councils can deny the building/designation of these centers. I am still considering condensing it to Census blocks as well. 

# Data
1. Cooling centers by 2019 from the Open Data County of Los Angeles. This allows me to know where the current cooling centers are located. https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/Cooling-Centers-in-LA-County-2019-/545q-nnas
2. Census Reporter for demographic data. This allows me to understand where and who is the most likely to be impacted. https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B02001&geo_ids=05000US06037&primary_geo_id=05000US06037
3. CalEnviroscreen 3.0 shows us where the most severely impacted areas of California as they are separated by percentiles describing the severity of of health impacts by census tract. https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40

# Scope
I will be including racial data to see the most impacted populations. The map will contain census data, curent and future climate projection data, current cooling centers, and suggested cooling center locations based on weather changes. CalEnviroScreen data is broken up by census tracts and they contain health information such as ashtma rates and exposure to pollution. This could inform me not only of its demographic data, but the information about the people impacted. I may change it to looking at the CalEnviroScreen data an seeing if each of the census tracts contain cooling centers and what disparities may be along the county. Lastly, for the cooling centers, I will be removing half of the data as I will not be considering parks or pools are cooling centers. 

# Conclusion
I hope to gain some understand as to how a hazard such a heat can severely impact individuals. This is will ensure that even if the state is't doing a great job of counting such tragedies, they will have existing cooling centers to reduce the total number of fatalities. The County needs to be preventative and not reactionary to these events.
