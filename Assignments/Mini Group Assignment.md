# Cooling Cnter Equity: Is Los Angeles County Prepared for Extreme Heat Events?
1. Celia's role: all of it: coding, writing, researching, you name it!
2. Status update: I am a bit worried about having to do all of the project. Essentially, I am responsible for all the aspects of the project. I haven't had a hiccup in coding. I talked to Yoh about the status of the project and it's uncertainty with the data. I will be switching the project to another, similar project. I will update the new project scope, but meanwhile, [here](https://github.com/Celiasz/Project/blob/main/Assignments/ProjectProposal.md) is the old one. 
3. Data update: Chris recommended using some of the CalEnviroScreen data which can be hepful for current conditions. I am using the Census data that we got from class as the demographic marker for who is affected by climate change. In addition, the benchmark for the cooling centers will be from the LA County open data repository and will be integrating walking distances between centers to analyze whether they are close enough to a community in case of an extreme heat event. 
4. Concerns: Major concerns - I am not sure if I should look at the entire Los Angeles county. Since it is only me that is doing the project, it might be more doable to only focus on a specific city for my project. Minor concerns - None.
