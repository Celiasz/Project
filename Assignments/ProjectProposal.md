# Research Proposal
My research question focuses on analysis whether the County of Los Angeles is prepared for more extreme heat. The question is, "Where can Los Angeles County build/designate new cooling centers as extreme heat events will become more frequently?"

# Why
The state of California is not taking extreme heat seriously. After an investigation with the Los Angeles Times uncovered, it shows that the state and city are undercounting deaths caused by heat waves and extrme high temperatures. As Governor Newsom has decided to focus on mitigating climate change impacts, they can focus on ensuring that those who do not have access to or can afford AC, they are able to cool themselves off during heat events in established cooling centers, I will not include parks or pools because even the usage of these spaces does not guarantee for someone to feel cool enough during heat events. If these measures are not taken, it can cause for thousands of fatilities as these heat events will become from frequent and stronger. 

# Spatial Scope
The area that I am focusing on is the County of Los Angeles. This matters to me as merely focusing on LA City or individual cities can take matters into their own hands. This can either be great or specific city councils can deny the building/designation of these centers. 

# Data
1. Cooling centers by 2019 from the Open Data County of Los Angeles. This allows me to know where the current cooling centers are located. 
2. Census Reporter for demographic data. This allows me to understand where and who is the most likely to be impacted. 
3. Cal Adapt from the state of California climate projections. I will be comparing 2020 temperatues with dry and warm weather with 2050 projection. Also, my baseline for 2050 will be using RCP 8.5 which is the using the worst case scenario for temperatures. This is if humans do not change their habits and conduct business as usual. 

# Scope
By utilizng future climate projections such as heat, it can let me know where exactly will higher temperatures affect different areas of the county. I will be comparing with currently designated cooling centers and will analyze if they will continue to be appropiate in the future. THe threshold (for future weather) will be that projected for 2050. With this analysis, it gives LA County enough time to prepare for such change in temperatures to mitigate deaths. In addition, I will be including racial data to see the most impacted populations. The map will contain census data, curent and future climate projection data, current cooling centers, and suggested cooling center locations based on weather changes. 

# Conclusion
I hope to gain some understand as to how a hazard such a heat can severely impact individuals. Heat is known as a silent killer and their deaths are severely undercounted. This is will ensure that even if the state is't doing a great job of counting such tragedies, they will have existing cooling centers to reduce the total number. The County needs to be preventative and not reactionary to these events.
