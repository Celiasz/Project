# Heat Climate Change Projections to Build More Cooling Centers in Vulnerable Communities
1. Celia's role: all of it: coding, writing, researching, you name it!
2. Status update: I am a bit worried about having to do all of the project. Essentially, I am responsible for all the aspects of the project. I haven't had a hiccup in coding. I am more concerned about the climate data. The Cal-Adapt data was the most accessible dataset I found, but I'm not sure it has geographical information. It might just be the numbers. There are maps with the heat information attacched to it, but they have to be requested and are not publicly available. 
3. Data update: Cal-Adapt data seems to be the most accessible California climate data. Chris recommended using some of the CalEnviroScreen data which can be hepful for current conditions, but again, I run into the problem of future projections. I am using the Census data that we got from class as the demographic marker for who is affected by climate change. In addition, the benchmark for the cooling centers will be from the LA County open data repository. 
4. Concerns: Major concerns - the climate data I was talking about. Also, I am not sure if I should look at the entire Los Angeles county. Since it is only me that is doing the project, it might be more doable to only focus on a specific city for my project. Minor concerns - None.
